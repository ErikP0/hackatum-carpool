# HackaTUM2018 Carpool

A project from Hackatum building an app for car pool.

## Inspiration
A new car sharing concept for the future 

## What it does
The driver has rented a car; wants to go from A to B at time X; wants to split costs by carpooling. He enters the information about the journey open the journey to the public carpool.

The passenger can input his position and destination to search in the public pool, whether there is a public router that helps him to get to his destination.  

The driver can decide whether he will give the passenger a ride or not.
