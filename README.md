# HackaTUM2018 Carpool

A project from Hackatum building an app for car pool.

## Business case

The transportation market is full of opportunities. Specially for young people, who are eager to travel but do not have the financial means to do so, often having to recur to whatever cheap options they can find. An alternative to trains and buses came in the form of car pooling, where the owner offers rides in his car and get a certain amount of money in return. The current options on the market for this services, however, lack in quality and many times the amount of available drivers, since not many people are willing to open their cars for strangers, even if they get some money in return. 

Our team sees a great opportunity in extending the services already provided by Sixt with an app that would offer the functionality of enabling Car Pooling when renting a car. This could increase revenue without having too much impact in the business, since the challenges and risks are similar for the existing use case of renting a car. It would open a new branch of the market, specially for young people that would now be able to rent a car and reduce the costs by offering rides, making the service attractive even in comparison to comon cheap transportation options like trains or busses by pottentially offering more comfort and freedom to adjust to their own plans.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration came by brainstorming our different problems when looking for options to travel. Even today, renting a car and sharing the costs with your friends already make a much better experience then using other transportation methods. By increasing the availability for this kind of service, the users profit by having more options to travel and the company profits by having a bigger demand in the rent service.
